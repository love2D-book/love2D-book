[[world1-1]]
=== The Concept
For the Purposes of this Book, we have decided to recreate the game http://www.freeasteroids.org/[Asteroids].

Before we start we need to think about how exactly this game works and what we want to include.
Thinking about the game before we start will keep us from getting lost in the
development process or adding feature after feature and losing interest before it is done.

So, how does Asteroids work?

In asteroids, the Player controls a small spaceship that is flying around.
He has to shoot asteroids that fly around the screen.
If he gets hit by an asteroid, the player loses a life and has to restart the round.
When he hits an asteroid, the asteroid splits into two smaller ones.

Alright, from these few rules we can already extract some things that we will need:

* a Spaceship / Player
* Asteroids
* Bullets

Next, let's see what each of these do or can do:

[[world1-1-spaceship]]
==== The Spaceship
The spaceship is the main thing the player can control in our game.
The player can use two keys to accelerate or decelerate in the direction the ship
is currently facing. He can also turn the spaceship with two other keys.
Lastly the player can press a button to fire a shot.

When the spaceships leaves the screen on one side, it will enter from the opposite side,
keeping its velocity.

We can see that the spaceship needs to have a `position`, `velocity` and `rotation`.
In <<world1-5, World 1-5>> we will see that the actual way of saving the information
we use differs, but we could as well do with this "definition".

==== The Asteroids
Asteroids move in a straight line, also wrapping around the Screen in the same way
the spaceship does.
The larger an asteroid is, the slower it should move.
Therefore all we need to know about every asteroid is his `position`, `size` and his `rotation`.

Whenever an asteroid is hit, we split it into two smaller ones, unless it is already
the smallest possible size. In that case we remove it altogether.

==== The Bullets
Bullets travel along a straight path, much like asteroids.
However they are removed from the game as soon as they hit an asteroid or leave the screen.

All bullets share the same speed, we only need to know the bullet's `position` and `rotation`.
