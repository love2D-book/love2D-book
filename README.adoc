View the rendered book with examples at https://love2d-community.github.io/love2d-book[love2d-community.github.io/love2d-book].

The collaborative book will be divided into three main units:

1. A walkthrough to building a small prototype and introducing the user to the LÖVE framework,
2. A more realistic revamp of the built prototype to create a "full" game, and lastly
3. An area of examples and snippets containing best and known practices in game development.

The book s written using a generator called Asciidoctor. +
Quick Reference: http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/

We have extended the AsciiDoctor syntax with *livecode* blocks and block macros.
There also are some other additions, you can use them like this:

[source,asciidoc]
----
livecode::test[] // <1>

livecode::test[name=test2] // <2>

[livecode,example] // <3>
++++
function love.draw()
    love.graphics.setColor( 255, 255, 0, 255 )
    love.graphics.rectangle( "fill", 10, 10, 100, 100 )
end
++++

code_example::world1/05_better-steering/rotation[] // <4>
code_example::world1/05_better-steering/rotation[exclude="lib/*,maps/*",include="**/*.lua,**/*.txt"] // <5>

wiki:love.graphics.setColor[] // <6>
wiki:love.graphics[the graphics module] // <7>
----
<1> loads love2D-book-code/test directory
<2> load love2D-book/code/test directory. It's name is test2 so it doesn't conflict with the first.
<3> runs the code below it; has the name of "example"
<4> shows all `.lua` files from the specified directory, except those in `lib/`
<5> shows all `.lua` and `.txt` files from the specified directory, except those in `lib/` and `maps/`
<6> links to the wiki page for `love.graphics.setColor` and formats the link accordingly
<7> links to the wiki page for `love.graphics` using the text `the graphics`

== Contributions
=== Prerequisites
You will need `ruby` and `bundler` to be installed for rendering the book.

With `ruby` set up, you can install bundler like so:

[source,bash]
$ gem install bundle

then install the dependencies:

[source,bash]
$ bundle install

=== Rendering
To render the ebook and pdf you can run `render.sh`:

[source,bash]
$ ./render.sh

but the preferred way to work on the project is by running *Guard*:

[source,bash]
$ bundle exec guard

this will automatically render the HTML ebook as you change the files.
You can use any LiveReload extension in a browser to have it automaically refresh as you modify the book.

=== Committing
Whenever a significant portion of the book has changed and is ready for release, stage the files on `master` and run `release.sh`.
Make sure that `book/code` is at the correct revision and staged before releasing.

=== Style Guidelines
* The three chapters are called __World__s and each section is a _Level_
* At the end of every _Level_, remind the reader about what he has learned in this chapter
* Use examples and concrete language wherever possible.
* Programming is all about abstraction, and examples help make this a lighter and more enjoyable read
* Make everything interesting to read about and motivate the reader to keep on learning
* Be clear and direct when talking something new. Keep it simple, stupid!
* Every Level ends with additional exercises that the reader can choose to try
* Give “Pro Tips” and “Watch out!”-notices where fitting (Admonitions)
* Use informal language and short text to show new content
* Keep lines shorter than 125 characters (soft rule, better have a slightly longer line than wrap two words)
* One sentence per line
* If sentences need to be wrapped due to length, try to wrap at a comma to keep the source readable
* Use the code repository for examples that readers may want to try out or modify, use inline livecode for minor changes and demos
* Style lists with `*`, don't end items with `.`
* Use wiki block macros when discussing LÖVE functions and concepts (`+wiki:love.graphics.print[print]+` -> wiki:love.graphics.print[print])
* Use backticks when mentioning Lua values (``"string"`` -> `"string"`)
* Link to sections you reference (`+<<world1-2, last Level>>+` -> <<world1-2, lastLevel>>)
* Show relevant portions of source code before livecode displays, use callouts (`<1>`) to discuss source code

Thank you for helping create this :)
